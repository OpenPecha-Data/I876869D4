		<h2>Translatorâs Introduction</h2>
<p>Few figures in the transmission of the Dharma from India to Tibet hold as central of a role as the great master <a href="/indian-masters/atisha/">AtiÅa DÄ«paá¹kara ÅrÄ«jÃ±Äna</a> (982â1055?). Often referred to in Tibetan simply by the epithet of âLordâ (Tib. <em>jo bo rje</em>), AtiÅa is the individual most associated with the eleventh-century revival of Buddhism in Tibet, which followed the tumultuous era of fragmentation (<em>sil buâi dus</em>) that began with the 842 collapse of the Tibetan Empire. His impact on the Tibetan Buddhist Dharma continues to reverberate to this day, nearly a full millennium after he first arrived in the Land of Snows, and his teachings have inspired millions of Buddhists in Central Asia and now the world over. A brief introduction to his life and activities may shed light on this foundational text. </p>

		<p>AtiÅa was born in 982 as the second son of a royal house in Bengal, eastern India. On the eve of an adolescent marriage, he experienced a powerful vision of TÄrÄ that motivated him to renounce the worldly life, even at this young age, and embark on the Buddhist path. He wandered through the jungles and mountains of India seeking the instruction of Buddhist masters, and he is said to have studied under a great number of mahÄsiddhas. There are also accounts that he may have practiced the tantric sexual yogas at this time.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>
<p>He received the bodhisattva vows from the master Bodhibhadra at the great Indian monastic university of NÄlandÄ. At twenty-nine, the same age that Siddhartha left the palace, AtiÅa had a dream in which he was urged by the Buddha himself to ordain, prompting him to take full monastic vows at a monastery in Bodh Gaya. Upon ordination, he was given the name DÄ«paá¹kara ÅrÄ«jÃ±Äna, âHe Whose Deep Awareness Acts as a Lamp.â With his relatively late ordination and scholarly pursuits, AtiÅaâs biography is an inverse of Indian mahÄsiddhas such as NÄropa, who only disrobed to practice tantra after many years living as a pure monk and scholar. AtiÅaâs full monastic ordination after nearly two decades spent as a wandering yogi demonstrates the tremendous esteem with which he held the Vinaya and monastic discipline, values reflected in the <em>Lamp for the Path</em> and his broader missionary activities in Tibet. </p>
<p>AtiÅaâs most important teacher is referred to in Tibetan texts as Serlingpa (âThe One from the Golden Island, Suvará¹advÄ«paâ), the Indonesian teacher also known as Suvará¹advÄ«pa DharmakÄ«rti. AtiÅa heard tell of this great master of bodhicitta and resolved to undertake the perilous ocean journey to meet him and receive his teachings. He spent many tumultuous months at sea, rife with danger and obstacles, before he finally crossed the Strait of Malacca and arrived at the island of Sumatra where he met the sublime master. AtiÅa remained on the island for twelve years, training intensively in <a href="/topics/bodhicitta/">bodhicitta</a> and <a href="/topics/lojong/">mind training</a> (<em>blo sbyong</em>). He then returned to India as a lineage holder of Serlingpaâs precious teachings and later served as the abbot the great monastic university VikramaÅÄ«la. In Tibet, he declared that of his forty-five teachers, Serlingpa was the most important; his numerous biographies report that the mere mention of Serlingpaâs name caused AtiÅaâs eyes to brim with tears. </p>
<p>The story of AtiÅaâs invitation to Tibet is one of the most legendary in the Buddhist history of the country. Toward the end of the tenth century, the king of the Western Tibetan kingdom of Purang-Guge (<em>pu hrangs gu ge</em>), Lha Lama Yeshe Ã, sent twenty-one young Tibetans to Kashmir with the aim of reviving uncorrupted Buddhist teachings in his kingdom. This was prompted by the belief that Buddhism had fallen into a state of intense moral decay with the collapse of the Tibetan empire. Nineteen of the youths perished on the journey, marking the first of many supreme sacrifices required to bring AtiÅaâs pure Dharma to Tibet. One of the two young men who survived was the great translator Rinchen Zangpo (958â1055), who informed the king of master AtiÅa, whose fame had spread from eastern India all the way to the western mountains of Kashmir. </p>
<p>The king sent a mission of nine men with a sizable offering of gold to VikramaÅÄ«la to implore AtiÅa to come to Tibet and restore the Buddhadharma. Only one of the nine survived the treacherous journey across the Himalayas and into India, but AtiÅa declined the invitation and gold, saying it was important he remain in India. </p>
<p>While amassing even more gold with which to invite the master, King Yeshe Ã was captured by the ardently anti-Buddhist Karluk (Qarluq) people, who said that the kingâs freedom could only be bought for his own weight in gold. His nephew Jangchub Ã raised the requisite fortune for the kingâs release only to have Yeshe Ã tell him to use the gold to again invite AtiÅa, now with the message that the king had sacrificed his very life to bring the master to Tibet.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> When AtiÅa heard the story of the kingâs supreme sacrifice, and on being urged directly by the goddess TÄrÄ herself, he accepted the invitation and departed for Tibet, where he would remain for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>The present text, <em>The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment</em>, is a masterpiece of Buddhist literature. As noted in the first and final verses, AtiÅa composed the treatise at the urging of Jangchub Ã, who became king following his uncleâs death. The text fully integrates the three vehicles of the Buddhaâs teachings and shows them to be entirely non-contradictory. Doboom Tulku and Glenn Mullin note that âit is largely due to [AtiÅa] that today all Tibetan sects of Buddhism are a combination of Hinayana, general Mahayana and Vajrayana doctrines.â<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> The great nineteenth-century master <a href="/tibetan-masters/patrul-rinpoche/">Dza Patrul Rinpoche</a> wrote that although AtiÅa had full mastery over the entire range of Buddhist teachings, sÅ«tra and tantra, the foundational practice of taking refuge was of such paramount importance to him that Tibetans nicknamed him the âRefuge Paá¹á¸ita.â<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> </p>
<p>AtiÅaâs masterwork is the foundational text for the â<a href="/topics/lamrim/">stages of the path</a>â (<em>lam rim</em>) genre so prominent in Tibetan Buddhist literature. Gampopaâs <em>Jeweled Ornament of Liberation (dam chos yid bzhin nor bu thar pa rin po cheâi rgyan)</em>, Tsongkhapaâs <em>Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (lam rim chen mo)</em>, and Longchenpaâs <em>Finding Rest in the Nature of Mind (sems nyid ngal gso)</em>, seminal classics of the KagyÃ¼, Gelug, and Nyingma schools respectively, all draw their basic framework from AtiÅa's <em>Lamp for the Path</em>. Given that this is one of the most foundational texts in Tibetan Buddhism, one which shaped the tradition as we know it today, it is a great honour to present this English translation.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> May it be of benefit!</p>

	<h2>The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment</h2>
<p><strong><em>by AtiÅa DÄ«paá¹kara</em></strong></p>
<p>In the language of India: <em>BodhipÄthapradipaá¹</em><br/>
In the language of Tibet: <em>jangchup lam gyi drÃ¶nma (byang chub lam gyi sgron ma)</em><br/>
In the English language: <em>The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment</em> </p>
<p>Homage to the youthful bodhisattva MaÃ±juÅrÄ«! </p>
<p>With great reverence, I prostrate to all the Victorious Ones of the three times,<br/>
to their Dharma, and to the members of the Saá¹gha.<br/>
Urged by my good student Jangchup Ã,<br/>
I shall elucidate the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment. </p>
<p>Understand there are three types of individualsâ<br/>
lesser, middling, and superior.<br/>
I shall set out a system of classification in which<br/>
their respective characteristics are made completely clear. </p>
<p>Know that those who, by whatever means,<br/>
exclusively seek mere mundane pleasures<br/>
of saá¹sÄra for their own benefit<br/>
are inferior individuals. </p>
<p>Those who have turned their backs on saá¹sÄraâs pleasures<br/>
and refrain from sinful karma,<br/>
striving merely for pacification for themselves aloneâ<br/>
such individuals are said to be middling. </p>
<p>Those who truly desire to completely eradicate<br/>
all the suffering of others<br/>
through their own personal sufferingâ<br/>
such individuals are supreme. </p>
<p>For these noble beings<br/>
who desire supreme enlightenment,<br/>
I shall explain the perfect methods<br/>
taught by spiritual teachers. </p>
<p>In the presence of paintings, statues,<br/>
stÅ«pas, and other representations of the perfect Buddha,<br/>
offer flowers, fragrant incense,<br/>
and whatever else you can afford. </p>
<p>With the seven-fold offering also<br/>
taught in <em><a href="/words-of-the-buddha/samantabhadra-aspiration-good-actions">Samantabhadraâs Aspiration to Good Deeds</a></em>,<br/>
and with the thought never to turn back<br/>
until attaining the essence of complete enlightenment, </p>
<p>With fervent faith in the Three Jewels,<br/>
place one knee on the ground,<br/>
join the palms together,<br/>
and first take refuge three times. </p>
<p>Then, beginning with a mind of love<br/>
for all sentient beings,<br/>
consider all those, without exception,<br/>
who suffer in the three lower realms<br/>
from birth, death, and so forth. </p>
<p>With the wish to liberate all beings<br/>
from the suffering of suffering,<br/>
from suffering and its causes,<br/>
generate bodhicitta with irreversible resolve. </p>
<p>Maitreya has thoroughly explained<br/>
the qualities of generating<br/>
such aspirational bodhicitta<br/>
in the <em>SÅ«tra of the Arrayed Tree</em>.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>
<p>Having understood the limitless qualities<br/>
of the mind of complete enlightenment<br/>
from reading this sÅ«tra or listening to a spiritual teacher,<br/>
generate this very state of mind again and again. </p>
<p>The <em>SÅ«tra Requested by VÄ«radatta</em><br/>
thoroughly explains its merits.<br/>
Here, I shall summarize them<br/>
by citing only three verses: </p>
<p>âIf the merit of bodhicitta<br/>
were to take physical form,<br/>
even the whole of space itself<br/>
could not contain its vastness. </p>
<p>âIf a person were to fill with jewels<br/>
as many buddhafields as there are<br/>
grains of sands in the Ganges River<br/>
and offer them to the Protector of the World, </p>
<p>âThis would be far surpassed by the offering<br/>
of someone joining their hands together<br/>
and bowing in their mind to enlightenment,<br/>
for this is beyond any limit.â </p>
<p>You should generate aspirational bodhicitta<br/>
and constantly increase it through great exertion.<br/>
You should fully uphold your precepts as instructed<br/>
so that you may recollect this in other lifetimes as well. </p>
<p>Without the actual vow of engaged bodhicitta,<br/>
your perfect aspiration will not develop further.<br/>
With the wish to develop perfect enlightenment,<br/>
make effort to take the vow in full. </p>
<p>Only those who continuously maintain<br/>
one of the seven types of individual liberation vows<br/>
or other vows will have the fortune for<br/>
the bodhisattva vow, no one else. </p>
<p>According to the TathÄgataâs explanation of<br/>
the seven classes of vows of individual liberation,<br/>
glorious pure conductâcelibacyâis said to be supreme.<br/>
Take, therefore, the vows of full ordination. </p>
<p>According to the ritual described in the<br/>
discipline chapter of <em>The Bodhisattva Levels</em>,<br/>
you should take the vow from a good,<br/>
authentically qualified spiritual teacher. </p>
<p>Understand that a good spiritual teacher<br/>
is one skilled in the vow ritual,<br/>
who lives by the vow and possesses<br/>
the patience and compassion to bestow it. </p>
<p>In case, after searching for someone like this,<br/>
you are unable to find such a spiritual teacher,<br/>
I shall explain another ritual<br/>
with which to properly take the vow. </p>
<p>With utmost clarity, I shall write how<br/>
long ago, when he was AmbarÄja,<br/>
MaÃ±juÅrÄ« generated bodhicitta,<br/>
as described in <em>The Ornament of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«âs<br/>
Buddhafield SÅ«tra</em>. </p>
<p>âIn the presence of the Protectors,<br/>
I generate the mind of perfect enlightenment,<br/>
and I invite all beings as my guestsâ<br/>
These I shall liberate from saá¹sÄra. </p>
<p>âFrom this moment until<br/>
I achieve supreme enlightenment,<br/>
I shall have no thoughts of harm,<br/>
no anger, avarice, or jealousy. </p>
<p>âI shall cultivate pure conduct,<br/>
and abandon sin and craving.<br/>
With joy for the vows of discipline,<br/>
I shall train to emulate the Buddhas. </p>
<p>âTaking no joy in swiftly<br/>
attaining enlightenment for myself,<br/>
I will remain until the very end<br/>
for the sake of even a single being. </p>
<p>âI shall prepare immeasurable,<br/>
inconceivable realms<br/>
and will remain in the ten directions<br/>
for any who call out my name. </p>
<p>âHaving purified all<br/>
physical and verbal actions,<br/>
I shall also purify my mental activities,<br/>
and will avoid all that is non-virtuous.â </p>
<p>Completely pure body, speech, and mind<br/>
cause you to maintain the actual vow of engaged bodhicitta.<br/>
By properly practicing the discipline of the three trainings,<br/>
your reverence for these trainings grows greater. </p>
<p>Therefore, by exerting yourself in the bodhisattva vows,<br/>
bent on pure and perfect enlightenment,<br/>
the accumulations for complete enlightenment<br/>
will be fully perfected. </p>
<p>All Buddhas say that the cause<br/>
for completing the accumulations,<br/>
whose natures are merit and wisdom,<br/>
is the development of the higher knowledges. </p>
<p>Just as a bird with unfledged wings<br/>
cannot fly through the sky,<br/>
one who lacks the power of the higher knowledges<br/>
will be unable to work for beingsâ benefit. </p>
<p>The merit of a single day and night<br/>
gained by one with the higher knowledges<br/>
is not attained within a hundred lifetimes<br/>
by one who is without them. </p>
<p>Those who desire to swiftly complete<br/>
the accumulations for perfect enlightenment<br/>
will accomplish the higher knowledges<br/>
through effort, not through laziness. </p>
<p>The higher knowledges will not arise<br/>
without the accomplishment of Åamatha;<br/>
therefore, strive again and again<br/>
to accomplish calm abiding. </p>
<p>As long as the requisites for Åamatha<br/>
are weak, even if you were to meditate<br/>
with great effort for thousands of years,<br/>
still you would not accomplish samÄdhi. </p>
<p>Therefore, maintaining the requisites<br/>
taught in the <em>Collection of SamÄdhi Chapter</em>,<br/>
place your mind on any suitable<br/>
virtuous object of focus. </p>
<p>When the practitioner achieves Åamatha,<br/>
higher knowledges are also attained.<br/>
But without the practice of the perfection of wisdom,<br/>
the obscurations will not be eliminated. </p>
<p>Therefore, in order to abandon, without exception,<br/>
all emotional and cognitive obscurations,<br/>
constantly meditate on the practice<br/>
of the perfection of wisdom with skillful means. </p>
<p>Wisdom without skillful means<br/>
and skillful means without wisdom<br/>
are said to be a form of bondage.<br/>
Therefore, do not relinquish either one. </p>
<p>To eliminate doubts concerning<br/>
what is wisdom and what are skillful means,<br/>
I shall clarify the correct distinction<br/>
between skillful means and wisdom. </p>
<p>With the exception of the perfection of wisdom,<br/>
the accumulations of all virtuous actions,<br/>
such as the perfections of generosity and so forth,<br/>
are described as skillful means by the Victorious Ones. </p>
<p>Whosoever cultivates wisdom<br/>
through the power of cultivating skillful means<br/>
will swiftly attain enlightenmentâ<br/>
but not through meditation on selflessness alone. </p>
<p>What we call âwisdomâ is thoroughly explained<br/>
as an understanding of the emptiness of inherent existenceâ<br/>
the realization that the aggregates, elements,<br/>
and sense sources are unproduced. </p>
<p>Logically, something existent cannot be produced,<br/>
nor can something nonexistent, like a sky-flower.<br/>
Consequently, as both faults would apply,<br/>
something which is both could likewise not come into being. </p>
<p>An entity is not produced from itself,<br/>
nor from something else, nor from both,<br/>
nor without causes. Therefore,<br/>
it has no inherent nature. </p>
<p>Alternatively, when you analyze any phenomenon<br/>
as to whether it is singular or multiple,<br/>
no inherent nature is observed.<br/>
Phenomena are thus determined to have no nature. </p>
<p>The reasoning in <em>The Seventy Verses on Emptiness</em>,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
<em>The Root Verses on the Middle Way</em>,<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> and so forth,<br/>
explains how it is proven that<br/>
the nature of all things is emptiness. </p>
<p>As this text would become too long,<br/>
I have not elaborated further here.<br/>
In order to facilitate your meditation,<br/>
I will fully explain only the established conclusions. </p>
<p>Thus, any meditation on selflessness<br/>
in which you do not observe the inherent nature<br/>
of any phenomena, without exception,<br/>
is, in and of itself, the cultivation of wisdom. </p>
<p>Just as wisdom sees no inherent nature<br/>
in any phenomena whatsoever,<br/>
let wisdom itself be subject to analysis,<br/>
and meditate free from conceptuality. </p>
<p>The nature of this existence,<br/>
which arises from conceptuality, is conceptuality.<br/>
Therefore, to abandon conceptuality<br/>
in its entirety is supreme nirvÄá¹a. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the Blessed One said,<br/>
âThe great ignorance of conceptuality<br/>
plunges us into the ocean of saá¹sÄra.<br/>
Resting in non-conceptual samÄdhi,<br/>
non-conceptuality is as clear as the sky.â </p>
<p>Similarly, in <em>The DhÄraá¹Ä« of Entering Non-Conceptuality</em>:<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a><br/>
âIf the heirs of the Victorious Ones<br/>
contemplate, without concepts, this noble Dharma,<br/>
they will transcend conceptuality, so hard to overcome,<br/>
and eventually attain the state of non-conceptuality.â </p>
<p>After gaining certainty from scriptures<br/>
and reasoning that all phenomena<br/>
are unproduced and without inherent nature,<br/>
meditate without conceptuality. </p>
<p>Accordingly, from meditating on suchness,<br/>
eventually, you will attain heat and other signs;<br/>
âSupreme Joyâ and the other bhÅ«mis will be attained;<br/>
And Buddhahood, the enlightened state, will not be far away. </p>
<p>If you wish to fully perfect the accumulations<br/>
for enlightenment with ease,<br/>
through pacifying, enriching, and the other activities<br/>
accomplished by the mantric powers; </p>
<p>through the power of eight great accomplishments;<br/>
through accomplishing the âfine vaseâ and othersâ<br/>
If you wish to take up the practice of Secret Mantra<br/>
as taught in the action, conduct, and other tantras, </p>
<p>then, in order to receive empowerment<br/>
from a vajra master, you must please the<br/>
noble spiritual teacher through veneration,<br/>
offerings of wealth and the like,<br/>
and endeavouring to carry out all commands. </p>
<p>Through the complete bestowal of the vajra master empowerment<br/>
by a spiritual master whom you have delighted,<br/>
you will be completely purified of all sins<br/>
and gain the fortune of accomplishing the siddhis. </p>
<p>As <em>The Great Tantra of the Primordial Buddha</em><br/>
emphatically forbids it,<br/>
those observing celibacy should never<br/>
receive the secret and wisdom empowerments. </p>
<p>If those practicing celibacy and asceticism<br/>
were to receive those empowerments,<br/>
they would be obliged to practice what is forbidden,<br/>
and their vows of austerity would thus deteriorate. </p>
<p>This creates a downfall which would<br/>
defeat those practicing yogic discipline.<br/>
As they would be certain to fall into the lower realms,<br/>
they would never gain accomplishment. </p>
<p>For those who have received the vajra master empowerment<br/>
and have knowledge of suchness, there is no fault<br/>
in receiving or teaching any tantra,<br/>
performing fire pÅ«jÄs, offerings, and so forth. </p>
<p>At the urging of Jangchub Ã,<br/>
I, the Elder DÄ«paá¹kara ÅrÄ«, have concisely<br/>
explained the Path of Enlightenment,<br/>
as Iâve seen it taught in the sÅ«tras and other Dharma teachings. </p>
<p><em>This concludes The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, composed by the great master DÄ«paá¹kara ÅrÄ«jÃ±Äna. It was translated and finalized by the great Indian abbot himself and the great translator and editor GewÃ© LodrÃ¶. This teaching was composed in the Toling Temple in Zhang Zhung.</em></p>
